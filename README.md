## TypeScript

You are to implement the following 3 tasks completely in TypeScript. You are NOT allowed to use `any` or to attempt to ignore the type safety of any parts of your submissions code.

### Task 1

```ts
addresses({
  staking_program_id: "5XDdQrpNCD89LtrXDBk5qy4v1BW1zRCPyizTahpxDTcZ",
  system_program_id: "11111111111111111111111111111111",
  locked_token_mint_id: "3bRTivrVsitbmCTGtqwp7hxXPsybkjn4XLNtPsHqa3zR",
});
```

In the example above, you have the function `addresses`.

`addresses` takes in a single record whose type is `Addresses`.

`Addresses` is a record type that maps strings to the type `string | { address: keys of Addresses }`, such that if you were to type the following code into the input that is of type `Addresses` to `addresses({ ... })` in the example above:

```ts
reward_token_mint_id: { address: "locked_token_mint
```

Your IDE should auto-complete your input above to:

```ts
reward_token_mint_id: { address: "locked_token_mint_id" },
```

Your first task is to type the declaration of the `addresses` function. In other words, you do NOT need to implement the body of `addresses`.

### Task 2

```ts
instructions({
  addresses: {
    staking_program_id: "5XDdQrpNCD89LtrXDBk5qy4v1BW1zRCPyizTahpxDTcZ",
    locked_token_mint_id: "3bRTivrVsitbmCTGtqwp7hxXPsybkjn4XLNtPsHqa3zR",
    reward_token_mint_id: { address: "locked_token_mint_id" },
    system_program_id: "11111111111111111111111111111111",
  },
  instructions: {
    admin_init: {
      accounts: [
        { id: "admin_id", signer: true },
        { id: "program_id", address: "staking_program_id" },
        { id: "locked_token_mint_id", address: "locked_token_mint_id" },
        { id: "reward_token_mint_id", address: "reward_token_mint_id" },
        { id: "system_program_id", address: "system_program_id" },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

Building on top of Task 2, you are to implement the `instructions` function above. It accepts a single record `input` that contains two keys: `addresses`, and `instructions`.

`addresses` is of the same format as `Addresses` in Task 1.

`instructions` maps to a record of arbitrary string keys to values of type:

```ts
{ accounts: Record<string, { id: string, signer?: true, address?: keys of Addresses }
```

What the function `instructions` does is return `input.instructions`, but:

For all `entry: { id: string, address: keys of Addresses }` entries in `instructions[keyof typeof instructions]["accounts"]`, the value of `address` is to be replaced with `input.addresses[entry.address]` if `input.addresses[entry.address]` points to a string.

If `input.addresses[entry.address]` points to a record of type `{ address: keys of Addresses }`, you are to recursively resolve for the string value of `address`.

### Task 3

You are given an arbitrary record `input` for the function `instructions(...)` in Task 2, and a `keyof typeof input`.

Write a helper utility type that returns the ids for all entries in `accounts` that do no have an `address` specified. In the example given in Task 2, this type helper should only return "admin_id".
